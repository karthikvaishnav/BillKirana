From Store to Screen, Effortless Management!
Welcome to BillKirana, a web app to digitize small and medium grocery stores across India, inspired by my dad‚Äôs kirana shop. As my first major web development project, I‚Äôm taking on a 10-day challenge to build a platform that empowers shop owners to manage inventory and customers to shop seamlessly‚Äîall with a few clicks! Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase, this is a work-in-progress with non-clean, non-responsive code (bear with me, I‚Äôm learning!). Join me in this journey to modernize local kiranas! üöÄ
Motivation
Growing up, I watched my dad manage his grocery store manually‚Äîtracking inventory, billing customers, and juggling records. This sparked the idea for BillKirana: a digital solution to streamline operations for small and medium kirana shops and enhance the shopping experience for customers. My goal is to empower local businesses to thrive in a digital world, one store at a time.
