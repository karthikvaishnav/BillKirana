# BillKirana
BillKirana is an ongoing web-based solution for managing a wholesale kirana store. I'm first building the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then integrating the backend for features like billing, profit tracking, and customer purchase history. The platform will streamline store operations with barcode scanning, digital bills, and analytics
